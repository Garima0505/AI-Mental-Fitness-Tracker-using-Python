# AI-Mental-Fitness-Tracker-using-Python

## üß†Project Overview

### **Project Title:** AI Mental Fitness Tracker

**Problem Statement:**
Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being. With the increasing prevalence of mental health disorders globally, it is essential to develop effective tools for monitoring and improving mental fitness. Traditional self-assessment methods often rely on subjective reporting, which can be biased and inaccurate. This project aims to create a reliable and objective system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to track and evaluate an individual's mental health status.

### üéØ Agenda
Mental Fitness Tracker Using Regression

### üë• End Users
This AI Mental Fitness Tracker is designed for individuals who want to track and enhance their mental fitness. By providing precise assessments, personalized recommendations, and continuous monitoring, it empowers users to actively manage their mental health.

### üí° Solution and Value Proposition
#### **Solution:**
An AI-powered Mental Fitness Tracker that utilizes regression analysis to accurately assess and monitor an individual's mental fitness. By analyzing factors such as mood, stress levels, sleep patterns, physical activity, and social interactions, it provides a comprehensive and data-driven evaluation of mental well-being.

### **Value Proposition:**

* Empowering Individuals: Allows users to take an active role in managing their mental health through accurate assessments, continuous monitoring, and personalized recommendations.
* Early Intervention and Prevention: Facilitates early detection of potential mental health issues, enabling proactive measures to prevent escalation.

### **üìÇ Datasets**
* Dataset 1[Dataset 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BHotRwLT2xVQEHTdiDY3Sj6P_3g7489L/view?usp=sharing)
* Dataset 2[Dataset 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B14pHI1jpVKSkaB0qJ59Bs55c2QjZYA2/view?usp=sharing)

### **üîß How We Customized the Project**
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Implemented Random Forest and Linear Regression models to enhance efficiency.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Modelling Steps**
* **Data Collection:** Gather information on mental health indicators such as mood, stress levels, sleep habits, activity levels, and social interactions.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency. Handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
* **Feature Engineering:** Identify and extract significant features that indicate mental fitness levels.
* **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., linear, polynomial, multivariate, ridge, or support vector regression).
* **Data Splitting:** Split the data into training and validation sets.
* **Model Training:** Train the regression models using the training set.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), R-squared value, or root mean squared error (RMSE).
* **Model Refinement:** Fine-tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters or exploring different regression techniques.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the models for continuous monitoring of mental health indicators.
